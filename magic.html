                          leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also had highly developed senses of self-preservation.
                          This
                          means that Slytherins tended to hesitate before acting, so all possible outcomes
                          before deciding exactly what should be done.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Slytherin had a well-known reputation for creating Dark witches and wizards that many would
                          even say that every Dark witch or wizard was actually in Slytherin (it also didn't help that
                          Voldemort himself was in Slytherin too when he was a student at Hogwarts).

                          nerve, and chivalry", and thus its
                          members were generally regarded as brave, though sometimes reckless. Some Gryffindors had also
                          been
                          noted to be short-tempered.

                          <br>
                          Gryffindors and Slytherins had shared a fierce house rivalry since their founders. There might
                          an
                          element of feeling wronged, as Harry and his fellow Gryffindors tended to win in a lot of
                          circumstances which, when
                          viewed from a neutral point of view, may be considered unfair.

                          members.[6] Thus, many Ravenclaws tended to be
                          academically motivated and talented students. They also prided themselves on being original in
                          their ideas, and methods.
                          It was not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic
                          that other houses might
                          shun.

                          <br>
                          Ravenclaws were so competitive when it came to academic success that they were known to
                          backstab each other, and likely
                          other students, in order to get top marks.

                          impartial. Hufflepuffs were not as competitive as the other houses, and were more modest about
                          their
                          accomplishments. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work,
                          dedication, patience,
                          loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its students.

                          Due to Helga Hufflepuff's policy is often thought to be the house of less talented
                          wizards and witches. However, this was merely a misunderstanding of the Sorting Hat's poem.

          <h1 id="texth101">Spell Book</h1>
          <p id="textp01"> 
            A spell was a controlled manifestation of magic that affected <br>
            the world in a supernatural fashion, suchas levitating objects, <br>
            conjuring fire or water, or stunning an individual. Generally <br> 
            cast by a witch or a wizard, spells were often produced with an <br>
            incantation, or for more experienced witches and wizards mentally, <br>
            and could appear as jets of light. Because of this, spells could <br>
            often miss, be dodged, or blocked, either with an object or another spell. <br>
            The action of performing a spell is referred to as casting or spellwork. <br><br>

            Normally, spells required four main factors to be properly accounted <br>
             for in order to succeed: wand movement, incantation, concentration and <br>
              intention. Although casting some spells were a matter of caster's will, <br>
               while for others, it was a question of intent, it was invariably the <br>
                case that if one did not move their wand in the correct way, did not <br>
                 speak the incantation properly and/or could not retain their concentration <br>
                  and/or desired outcome in their imagination during casting, then the spell <br>
                   would fail or backfire. In addition, the quality and duration of spells <br>
                    depended entirely on the amount of spell energy they were capable of <br>
                     generating for it, as well as their level of success at transferring and <br>
                      distributing it, which could be improved with practice or decline with neglect.

            A wand was a quasi-sentient magical instrument through which a witch <br>
             or wizard channelled their magical powers to centralise the effects <br>
              for more complex results.[3] Most spells were cast with the aid of wands,
               <br> but spells could be cast without the use of wands. Although <br>
                wandless magic was more common in other countries, such as some in <br>
                 Africa, European wizards were generally used to using the tool and <br>
                  found wandless magic more difficult, requiring much more concentration <br>
                   and skill to perform these spells.
                   <br>
                   <br>

              Magic with a wand was usually performed with an incantation, but more <br>
               experienced wizards could cast nonverbal spells, which concealed the spell <br>
                until cast and might thereby prevent an opponent from adequately protecting <br>
                 him- or herself in time. Wands were referred to as "quasi-sentient" because <br>
                  their being imbued with a great deal of magic made them as animate as an <br>
                   inanimate object could be.
                    <br>
                    <br>

              Every single wand was unique and would depend for its character on the particular <br>
               tree and magical creature from which it derived its materials. Moreover, each wand, <br>
                from the moment it found its ideal owner, would begin to learn from and teach its <br>
                 human partner.
